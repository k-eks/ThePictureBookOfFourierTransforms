Notes for the creators:
As it was Arkadiy's whish, I have created repository which is now open for submissions. In the following, I drafted a first description of this project and some general guide lines. Notify me or change these if you room for improvement which is most certainly the case. As far as I remember, Arkadiy already has some source code for doing the transform which I would suggest we all use to have a consistent design.

# The Picture Book Of Fourier Transforms

## The Idea
The idea behind this project is to compile a collection of Fourier transforms of crystal structures and real life objects to give an easy access to understand (x-ray) scattering features, such as diffuse scattering.

## Submissions
Before submitting a picture, make sure you own the rights and want to share the picture with the rest of the world.

Pictures are submitted via the issue tracker. Simply drag and drop the picture into the text field. Please use one of the provided lables to categorize the picture. If there is no fitting label, add one or make request for a new one. Also add a short description of what your picture is showing and if applicable, if there is a connection or a common teaching goal with another picture in the collection present, please link them together with #issue-number.
