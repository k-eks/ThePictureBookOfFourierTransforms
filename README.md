Notes for the creators:
As it was Arkadiy's whish, I have created repository which is now open for submissions. In the following, I drafted a first description of this project and some general guide lines. Notify me or change these if you room for improvement which is most certainly the case. As far as I remember, Arkadiy already has some source code for doing the transform which I would suggest we all use to have a consistent design.
